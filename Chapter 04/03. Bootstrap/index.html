                Madrid, cheerful and vibrant at all hours, is famous for being an open city with all kinds of people from anywhere in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to its famous museums, busy streets dotted with all kinds of shops, restaurants with world cuisine and unbeatable nightlife, Madrid will surprise you with its tranquil historic spots that charm everyone walking by. Here you'll find traditional family-run, century-old bars where friends meet up for a drink, every style of neighbourhood and cultural centres that offer up an alternative type of tourism. Madrid's authenticity is hard to beat. It is welcoming and diverse. Madrid is, without a doubt, one of Europe’s most interesting cities.

                Culture and leisure at any time

                Anyone in search of culture will find some of the most important museums in the world, such as the Prado, Reina Sofía or Thyssen. But we must not forget smaller options, full of charm, such as the Sorolla Museum or cultural centres like the Matadero or Conde Duque, which are continuously offering innovative exhibitions, concerts, guided tours, etc.
                Walking around Madrid means coming across iconic spots such as the stunning Royal Palace, the Plaza Mayor with 400 years of history, the buzzing Puerta del Sol, the famous Gran Vía full of shops, or the four tallest towers in Spain. Each neighbourhood offers a different experience: La Latina is ideal for tapas, Las Letras has the perfect combination of literature and fine dining… But Madrid also means relaxing in enormous green spaces such as the Retiro Park (which together with the Paseo del Prado boulevard have been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List), and other lesser-known but equally charming parks like El Capricho.

                Capital of food, fashion and nightlife

                When it's time to eat, Madrid has many different options, each more appealing than the last. On the one hand, traditional bars where you can discover the old-fashioned, unpretentious atmosphere known as ‘castizo’, and why tapas are so much fun. On the other hand, there are its cutting-edge restaurants like DiverXO and traditional markets that have been turned into new gourmet spaces, such as San Miguel, which has become a true gastronomic shrine. In Madrid, the time is always ripe to enjoy an animated, urban atmosphere. For example, the increasingly famous weekend brunches in enclosed glass terraces, courtyards, rooftops, etc.
                Fashionistas will find all options: luxury shops on the Golden Mile, vintage establishments in areas such as Fuencarral, new designer markets like the Mercado de Motores, and craft workshops and bookshops over 100 years old. At dusk, some of the city’s viewpoints will surprise you with unique sunsets, at the Temple of Debod or the rooftop bar of the Círculo de Bellas Artes, for example. And at the end of the day... nightlife in Madrid is legendary with live music, all kinds of ambiences, music until the sun comes up...
                Madrid has its own beauty. Madrid stimulates and inspires. Madrid. You have to experience it.
